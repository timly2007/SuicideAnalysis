# SuicideAnalysis
Suicide Predictor with Big Data Analytics.

The goal of this project is to investigate the correlation between indicators of happiness, demographic variables, and socionomic variables against the annual suicide rate per 100k population. The predictive model utilizes a random forest algorithm, and calculates a NRMSE based off of the given dataset.

The dataset is agglomerated from the sources below:
